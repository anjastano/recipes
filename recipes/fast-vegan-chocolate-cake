## {{< fa basket-shopping >}} Ingredients

- 400 g flour  
- 70 g cocoa powder  
- 200 g sugar  
- 2 packets vanilla sugar   
- 1 packet baking powder 
- 480 ml water  
- 200 ml sunflower oil  

## {{< fa kitchen-set >}} Procedure

1. Grease a round springform pan (26 cm diameter) with a little oil. Preheat the oven to 180°C (top/bottom heat).  
2. Briefly mix the flour, cocoa powder, sugar, vanilla sugar, and baking powder in a bowl.  
3. Add the water and sunflower oil to the dry ingredients and stir well until a smooth batter forms.  
4. Pour the batter into the prepared springform pan.  
5. Bake the cake for 35–40 minutes. The cake is done when a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.  
6. Let the cake cool before removing it from the pan.  

### Tip:

Feel free to add different nuts or chocolate chips to the batter according to your preference and taste.  

### Note:

Many say vegan cakes don’t taste good, but I’ve proven them wrong time and time again. This cake tastes just as delicious and chocolatey, but without any animal products. Try it for yourself and be convinced!
